With You Around

Do you remember when I said you were my only one? 
We were running underneath the California sun
Well now I look at you, and you're still more than I can take 
You're like a slow song, starting to accelerate

And all my life, I looked for you
For arms that I could fall into 

All I can think about is 
You and me driving with a Saves the Day record on 
We were singing till our voices were gone
And I was falling hard, you were barely hanging on
And now I wanna chase forever down, with you around

You're making movies in your head when you fall asleep 
Having nightmares, dreaming that I'm gonna leave 
I know you've always been afraid of ending up alone 
Somebody hurt you, now you're waiting on a dial tone

But I'm right here, so don't get blue
It's not just you, I need this too

All I can think about is 
You and me driving with a Saves the Day record on
We were singing till our voices were gone.
And I was falling hard, you were barely hanging on.
And now I wanna chase forever down, with you around

We were running underneath the California sun 
Underneath the California sun

All I can think about is 
You and me driving with a Saves the Day record on 
We were singing till our voices were gone
And I was falling hard, you were barely hanging on

We put a record on
Kept singing till our voices were gone
And I was falling hard, you were barely hanging on
And now I wanna chase forever down 
(We were running underneath the California sun) 
I just wanna chase forever down, with you around
