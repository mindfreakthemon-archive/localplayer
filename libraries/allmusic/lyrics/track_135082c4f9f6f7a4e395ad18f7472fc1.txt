Money,
All for money,
Make your money,
Hide your money,
Stuff your money,
Hump your money
Save your money
All for money,

Waning patience
People's appetite
Disposition
This possession
Dispossessed from all the attractions,
Dancing bears of eroticism,
Self absorbed delusion
Inclusion of dysfunction
I now await the triumphant
Lost baggage, train station,

The causes of ineptitude
Can be traced to my mandatory down,
The causes of my servitude
Can be traced to the tyranny of

Money,
All for money,
Make your money,
Hide your money,
Stuff your money,
Hump your money
Save your money
All for money,

My final surrender
Away from inclusion
I now await the triumphant
Left baggage, train station,

The causes of ineptitude
Can be traced to my mandatory down,
The causes of my servitude
Can be traced to the tyranny of a down,
The causes of ineptitude
Can be traced to my mandatory down,
The causes of my servitude
Can be traced to the tyranny of

Money,
All for money,
Make your money,
Hide your money,
Stuff your money,
Hump your money
Save your money
Make your money
Hide your money
All for money
Make your money
Hide your money
Stuff your money
Hump your money
Save your money
All for money,
Money, money, money, money.
