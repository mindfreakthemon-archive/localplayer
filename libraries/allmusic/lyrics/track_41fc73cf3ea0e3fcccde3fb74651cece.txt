The Sound Of You And Me

Are you there putting all the words together?
Painting your new master piece
Ocean air carrying reminders of that perfect pair we used to be

Someday everything ends
Can't we begin finding a way back before we're too late
And lost in between the truth and the dream
I've never been more ready to move on

Changing keys, giving up on me to find familiar things and try blending in
Know this please
I will not forget the sound of you and me when we were friends

Someday everything ends
Can't we begin finding a way back before we're too late
And lost in between the truth and the dream
I've never been more ready to move on

Bring walls down
Hear all my sound
Let me back in
Love me again

Bring walls down
Hear all my sound
Let me back in
Love me again

Bring walls down
Hear all my sound
Let me back in
Love me again
