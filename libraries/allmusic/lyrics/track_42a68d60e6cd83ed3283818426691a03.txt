See Me Smiling

The sun comes up and you are all over my mind
You're in my brain before I can open my eyes
As I go on without you
My heartbeat wont slow down
I need you back like I need air to breath this out

All I can do is keep you closer now
'Cause I know your somewhere out there looking down
Wherever you are (Wherever you are)
I hope you can see me smiling

The sky gets dark, I watch the water here at home
It's 10 years now and I'm still learning to let go
I'ts not the same without you 
Theres no one keeping time
You were the rhythm that was bringing us to life 

All I can do is keep you closer now
'Cause I know you're somewhere out there looking down
Wherever you are (Wherever you are)
I hope you can see me smiling now (I hope you can see me smiling)

Sometimes I can't help think that I have you right behind me all this time
If only you could have a chance to see 
All the happiness you gave to me

All I can do is keep you closer now
'Cause I know you're somewhere out there looking down
Wherever you are
I hope you can see me smiling now (I hope you can see me smiling)
I hope you can see me smiling
