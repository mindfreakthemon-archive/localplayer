Why do we sit around and
Break each other's hearts tonight?
Why do we dance around
The issues 'till the morning light?
When we sit and talk
And tear each other's lives apart.
You were the one to tell me go...

But you were the one for me,
And now you're going through the door,
When you take that step
I love you baby more and more,
We need to laugh and sing and cry
And warm each other's hearts tonight,
Having fun of everything
And loving all of mother god

Tearing us,
You're tearing us,
You're breaking us,
You're breaking us,
You're carrying us,
Carrying us,
You're saving us,
You're saving us...

You're tearing us,
You're tearing us,
You're breaking us,
Breaking us,
You're killing us,
Killing us,
You're saving us...

Why do we sit around and
break each other's hearts tonight?
Why do we dance around
the issues 'till the morning light?
When we sit and talk
and tear each other's lives apart.
You were the one to tell me go...

But you were the one for me,
And now you're going through the door,
When you take that step
I love you baby more and more,
We need to laugh and sing and cry
and warm each other's hearts tonight,
Having fun of everything
and loving all of mother god

You're tearing us,
You're tearing us,
You're breaking us,
You're breaking us,
You're killing us,
Killing us,
You're saving us,
You're saving us...

You're tearing us,
You're tearing us,
You're breaking us,
You're breaking us,
You're killing us,
Killing us,
You're saving us...
