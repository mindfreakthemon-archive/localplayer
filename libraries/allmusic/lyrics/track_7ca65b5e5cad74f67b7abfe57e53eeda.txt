Hide

Haven't heard from you in days
I'm spreading thin what I got saved
And I've come down from your highest highs
Now what the hell am I supposed to say?

Whoa, I know it feels like I let you down
(I let you down)
But I'm still around
(But I'm still around)

If you can't find a way to reach me, take your time
I could be underneath you
And looking up to see you
From where we used to hide
From where we used to hide

Busy writing thoughts tonight
A message sent with no reply
You used to hang on my every word
(My every word)
Now they never come out right

Whoa, I know it feels like I let you down
(I let you down)
But I'm still around
(But I'm still around)

If you can't find a way to reach me, take your time
I could be underneath you
And looking up to see you
From where we used to hide
From where we used to hide

You are invisible in this
(So invisible in this)
You're too caught up in what you missed
(Caught in what you missed)
So spend what I gave
I'll give you more
You are invisible in this

If you can't find a way to reach me, take your time
I could be underneath you
And looking up to see you
From where we used to hide
From where we used to hide

If you can't find a way to reach me, take your time
'Cause I am underneath you
And looking up to see you
From where we used to hide
From where we used to hide
