Let the record play,
Let the record play,
Let the record play.

The way that you dance,
The way that you move,
The way that you stare at me across the room,
You carry Dior bags,
And you got your Chanel,
You wear Louis Vuitton, HG and YSL,
Now I got what you need,
I got DCMA,
I got brass knuckles hanging,
From my neck in my chain,
I got a model 26,
But she stays in her place,
I got a curve shirt neatly,
Tucked inside in my waist.

And the record keeps playing,
The same old song,
The hipsters been muggin' on me all night long,
They say "Aha, ahha",
Keep your hands off my girl,
Keep your hands off my girl,
They say "Aha, ahha",
But the record keeps playing,
The same old song,
They say "Aha, ahha",
Keep your hands off my girl,
Keep your hands off my girl.

Now she sweating my friends,
And my hurricane shoes,
She likes the records I spin,
MY Adam Barton tattoos,
But she can't say "what's up",
So what does she do,
She just stays posted up,
The other side of the room,
I got AMC tattooed on my hand,
I got black wall street on a black bandana.

And the record keeps playing,
The same old song,
The hipsters been muggin' on me all night long,
They say "Aha, ahha",
Keep your hands off my girl,

Keep your hands off my girl,
They say "Aha, ahha",
But the record keeps playing,
The same old song,
They say "Aha, ahha",
Keep your hands off my girl,
Keep your hands off my girl.

She, she, she don't wanna talk about it,
He, he, he wants to fight about,
Me, me, I don't wanna fight about it,
I just wanna be about it,
I'm just trying to stay about it,
Step out the wagon,
You know the boy starts to hate,
The girl that came with him,
They like that's not the boy she dates,
They get to fighting and swearing,
And now the boyfriend is staring,
The disco ball on the ceiling,
Looks like the chain that I'm wearing,
But the music keeps playing

I got brass knuckles hanging,
from my neck in my chain,
I got brass knuckles hanging,
from my neck in my chain.

And the record keeps playing,
The same old song,
The hipsters been muggin' on me all night long,
They say "Aha, ahha",
Keep your hands off my girl,
Keep your hands off my girl,
And the record keeps playing,
The same old song,
The hipsters mean muggin' on me all night long,
They say "Aha, ahha",
Keep your hands off my girl,
Keep your hands off my girl.

You carry Dior bags,
And you got your Chanel,
You wear Louis Vuitton, HG, and YSL,
Now I got what you need,
I got DCMA,
I got brass knuckles hanging,
From my neck in my chain,
I got brass knuckles hanging,
From my neck in my chain.
