Title: Mona Lisa (When the World Comes Down)
Artist: The All-American Rejects
Here's another pity
There's another chance
You tried to learn a lesson
But you can't


If we could burn a city
And the future's ending fast
Without a change our lives will never last
We're going fast


You can sit beside me when the world comes down
If it doesn't matter than just turn around
We don't need our bags
And we can just leave town
You can sit beside me when the world comes down


What can we do better?
When will we know how?
A man says from the sidewalk to the crowd


If you can change the weather
If you wanted to yourself
Well if you can't
I guess we all need help
Cause i need help


You can sit beside me when the world comes down
If it doesn't matter than just turn around
We don't need our bags
And we can just leave town
You can sit beside me when the world comes down


We say,
We do,
The lies, the truth
And all i need is next to me


We're going fast


You can sit beside me when the world comes down
If it doesn't matter than just turn around
You be the queen, and i'll be your clown
You can sit beside me when the world comes down
You can sit beside me when the world comes down
