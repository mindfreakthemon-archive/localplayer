For You, And Your Denial

4 am you called to spit some fire out
Did you think that I would listen to you now
It's nothing new so get in line with all the rest
I will wait 'til you realize you're out of breath

Can you hear the crowd they all go wild
For you, and your denial
Watching you break down
Hate me all you want I'll be okay
I'm half the world away
And I'm letting you go now 

You've got sadness twisted up with jealousy
You show your fists to make them look like loyalty
And I have seen what holding on can take away
If it's the past you love then that's where you can stay

Can you hear the crowd they all go wild
For you and your denial
Watching you break down
Hate me all you want I'll be okay
I'm half the world away
And I'm letting you go now

Desperation kills 
But when its on your sleeve you wear it well
And underneath it all
You'll always have this war inside yourself

I'm letting you go now

Can you hear the crowd they all go wild
For you and your denial
Watching you break down
Hate me all you want I'll be okay
I'm half the world away
And I'm letting you go now
