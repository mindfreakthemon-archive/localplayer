Lyrics taken from www.lyricsmania.com
I'm swimming up stream

I'm climbing up hill

And it feels like maybe I always will

How do I fix this broke down heart

Just look at me baby I'm fallin' apart



Why I woke up this mroning only heaven knows

Spilled my cup of coffee and I burnt my toast

Can't find the keps 'cause they're locked in my car

Just look at me baby I'm fallin' apart



I remember the moment you looked in my eyes

You said that you loved me, then you said goodbye

Oh and right then there is where I lost my spark

Now look at me baby I'm fallin' apart

Just look at me baby



I'm trying to be strong

But I need some time

Gotta get myself together

I've made up my mind

But how do I move on when I don't know where to start

Just look at my baby I'm fallin' apart



I remember the moment you looked in my eyes

You said that you loved me, then you said goodbye

Oh and right then there is where I lost my spark

Just look at me baby I'm fallin' apart



Just look at me baby I'm fallin' apart

Now look at me baby

Just look at me baby
