Sing For Me

Look at me
And listen close
So I can tell you how I feel before I go
Just a year
It's not much time
For me to show you I am proud that you are mine

I wish I had known the future in my heart
Was just about to start

Save tomorrow
I can't follow you there 
Just close your eyes and sing for me
I will hear you
Always near you
And I'll give you the words just sing for me

Every lock
On every door
I put them there to try and hide you from the world
And you kicked
Yeah, you screamed
You never understood, you're everything to me

I just hope you know, the future in your heart
Is just about to start

Save tomorrow
I can't follow you there 
Just close your eyes and sing for me
I will hear you
Always near you
And I'll give you the words just sing for me

No looking back when I am gone (sing for me)
Follow your heart it's never wrong (sing for me)
No looking back when I am gone (sing for me)
Don't second guess the note you're on

Out of time
All out of fight
You are the only thing in life that I got right

Save tomorrow
I cant follow you there 
Just close your eyes and sing for me
I will hear you
Always near you
And I'll give you the words just sing for me

Woah-oh-oh-oh, Woah-oh-oh-oh
Just close your eyes and sing for me (sing for me)
Woah-oh-oh-oh, Woah-oh-oh-oh
Just close your eyes and sing for me
