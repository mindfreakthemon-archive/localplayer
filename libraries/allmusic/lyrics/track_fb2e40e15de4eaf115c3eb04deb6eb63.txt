Waking ten times to take a piss
you can taste the cancer in my morning kiss
Scratch the rash on my back, perfect bliss
you want a life companion and you're getting this

men can get a few dimes
and man can get it up few times

men can get a few dimes
and man can get it up few times

You have to look away at my every meal
inconvenient, but that's the deal
This is what we've become when nothing's real
mental wounds that never heal

men can get a few dimes
and man can get it up few times

men can get a few dimes
and man can get it up few times

man can get a few dimes
and man can get it up few times

man can get a few dimes
and man can get it up few times
