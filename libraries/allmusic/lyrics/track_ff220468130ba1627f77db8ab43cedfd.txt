Life Of Leaving Home

I can see all the footsteps left behind
Every second I gave
Every song was a snapshot of my life 
I needed something to say

It started out in the last slow motion scene 
Watching everyone change
Made a map of the one way road from here
Had no reason to stay

I am awake and alive
There is something calling me
More than a moment in time
It's a dream I'm following, on my own (On my own)
On my own

More than a moment in time
It's a life of leaving home

Think of me when the stars come out tonight
Take a look at the sky
Never said that I could burn out that bright, but I needed to try

I am awake and alive
There is something calling me
More than a moment in time
It's a dream I'm following, on my own (On my own)
On my own

More than a moment in time
It's a life of leaving home 

The day that I found my voice 
I knew that I had no choice
The only way I learned to love is if I found it on my own
On my own

I am awake and alive
There is something calling me
More than a moment in time
It's a dream I'm following on my own (On my own)
On my own (On my own)
On my own 
On my own

More than a moment in time
It's a life of leaving home
