Title: real world

I wonder what it's like to be the rainmaker
I wonder what it's like to know that I made the rain
I'd store it in boxes with little yellow tags on everyone
And you can come and see them when I'm... done, when I'm done
I wonder what it's like to be a super hero
I wonder where I'd go if I could fly around downtown
From some other planet, I get this funky high on yellow sun
Boy I bet my friends will al be... stunned, they're stunned
Straight up, what did you hope to learn about here
If I where someone else, would this all fall apart
Strange, where were you, when we started this gig
I wish the real world, would just stop hastling me

I wonder what it's like to be the head honcho
I wonder what I'd do if they all did just what I'd said
I'd shout out an order, I think we're out of this man get me some
Boy don't make me wanna change my... tone, my tone
Straight up, what did you hope to learn about here
If I where someone else, would this all fall apart
Strange, where were you, when we started this gig
I wish the real world, would just stop hastling me
Please don't change, please don't break
The only thing that seems to work at all is you
Please don't change, at all from me
To you, and you to me

Straight up, what did you hope to learn about here
If I where someone else, would this all fall apart
Strange, where were you, when we started this gig
I wish the real world, would just stop hastling me
